**For Maintainers:** If this is confirmed to be a bug with proper reproduction steps, consider converting to an issue using "Convert to issue" in the discussion menu.

**For the Reporter:** To help us triage this effectively, please provide:
- [ ] Katana version (\`katana -version\`)
- [ ] Complete command that reproduces the issue
- [ ] Expected vs actual behavior
- [ ] Operating system and environment details
- [ ] Any error messages or logs

This helps us determine if this should become a tracked issue. Thank you! 🚀`;
              
              } else {
                response = `👋 Thanks for your question! 

The community and maintainers will help answer this. If this turns out to be a bug or feature request after discussion, a maintainer can convert it to a tracked issue.

**💡 Tip:** For faster responses, you can also join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/projectdiscovery) for real-time help!`;

**For Maintainers:** If this feature request is well-defined and approved for implementation, consider converting to an issue using "Convert to issue" in the discussion menu.

**For the Reporter:** To help evaluate this feature:
- [ ] Describe the specific use case this would solve
- [ ] Explain how this would benefit the katana user community  
- [ ] Consider if this could be implemented as a plugin or external tool
- [ ] Check if similar functionality already exists

Well-defined features with clear benefits may be converted to tracked issues for implementation. Thanks for contributing! 🚀`;
